    <h2>Tartare steak with a recipe which is a feast for the palate</h2>
    <p>A must-have item on the menu of every Tartare lover. A delicious, well-seasoned taste that will surely appeal to each of your guests. We serve Tatar as a side dish, and we all know what it is usually served with.</p>
    <p>Poles love Tatar, I am Polish and have been eating it since I was a kid. But there are few exceptions to the rule, not everyone will eat raw meat or raw egg. Before you make a Tatar make sure you start out with the best and freshest ingredients, and you have to know the sources where it came from. Enjoy and Smacznego!</p>
