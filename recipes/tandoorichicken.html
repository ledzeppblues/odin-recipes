    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ chicken skinless thighs or legs</li>
        <li>Half cup Greek yogurt "hung curd"</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cup Greek yogurt "hung curd"</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper powder</li>
        <li>teaspoon black pepper crushed</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kasuri methi</li>
    </ul>   
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Greek yogurt also known as hung curd is the key ingredient used in the marinade. It is nothing but curd that has been strained of all the whey/liquid. If you do not have Greek yogurt,To a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Be careful not to add a lot. Use as required depending on how sour your yogurt is.</li>
        <li>Pour 1½ tablespoon oil as well. In India, mustard oil is used for a unique flavor. If you want you may use it or any other cooking oil as per your preference.</li>
        <li>Mix well and taste the marinade. Add any ingredient needed to suit your taste like salt and chili powder. The marinade has to be thick as shown in the picture and should not be runny. A runny marinade will let out moisture to the pan and the chicken won't hold the spices well.</li>
        <li>Pat dry the chicken with kitchen tissues. You can use ½ to ¾ kg (1.1 to 1.5 lbs) chicken thighs or legs. Next make deep slits into the chicken.</li>
        <li>Marinate the chicken well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours to over night. Do not reduce the time as the chicken will not get cooked and turn tender. You can keep this as long as 48 hours in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>To make the chili oil for a spicy version, mix together 1 tsp red chilli powder with 1 to 2 tbsps oil.</li>
        <li>Roast in Oven - Preheat the oven to 240C for at least 15 to 20 mins. Prepare a baking tray with a foil for easy cleanup. Place a wired rack over it, spray/grease oil on the rack. Place the prepared chicken with a thick marinade over the wired rack. Bake for 12 to 15 mins, baste with chili oil/ melted butter and turn the chicken to the other side. Check at 12 mins mark. <p>Bake for another 12 to 15 mins, followed by 2 to 3 mins of broiling if required. Adjust the timing as needed depending on the size of your chicken and oven. If your oven does not have a broil mode, move the rack to the top most level and roast until slightly charred for 3 mins.</p></li>
        <p><strong>To check if the chicken is cooked through, an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part should read 75C.</strong></p>
